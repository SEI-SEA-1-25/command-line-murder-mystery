CLUE 1: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is at least 6' tall.

CLUE 2: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, 
        and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. 
        The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.

CLUE 3: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. 
        He said a person left right before they heard the shots. 
        The name on their latte was Annabel, they had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.



latest clue 4: However, they report seeing the car that fled the scene. 
             Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9"


latest clue 5: Mr. Fuglsang has brown hair.  Not the witness from the cafe.
